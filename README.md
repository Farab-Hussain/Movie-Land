# Movie Search App

Welcome to the Movie Search App! This web application allows users to search for any type of movie by title, fetching and displaying relevant movie information such as titles, posters, and descriptions using an external API. Whether you're looking for classic films or the latest releases, this app is designed to provide a fast and simple search experience.

## Features

### üîç Search Any Movie
The primary feature of the Movie Search App is its ability to search for movies based on user input. Simply enter the name of the movie you're looking for, and the app will retrieve the most relevant results from the API.

- **Search Bar**: A responsive search bar is available on the homepage. As users type, the app fetches the most relevant results dynamically.
- **Instant Feedback**: Results are displayed in real-time, providing users with a smooth search experience.

### üé• Movie Information Display
Once the search results are retrieved, the app displays the following information for each movie:

- **Title**: The name of the movie.
- **Poster**: A visual representation of the movie (movie poster or thumbnail).
- **Description**: A short summary or synopsis of the movie.

These details allow users to quickly identify the movie they're looking for and get basic information at a glance.

### ‚ö° API Integration
This app relies on a third-party API for retrieving movie data, which includes movie titles, images, and descriptions. The integration is seamless, allowing the app to fetch and display real-time information. This feature enables users to stay updated with the latest movies, as the API regularly updates its database.

- **Asynchronous Fetching**: Data fetching is handled asynchronously, ensuring that the app remains responsive and user-friendly, even when the network is slow.
- **Error Handling**: In the case of a failed API request, the app gracefully displays an error message, informing the user that something went wrong.

### üåê Responsive Design
The app has been designed with responsiveness in mind, meaning it works perfectly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

- **Mobile Friendly**: The search bar, results display, and movie cards are fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience for mobile users.
- **Desktop Optimized**: The layout adapts to larger screens, ensuring that desktop users have an enhanced viewing experience.

### üé® User Interface and Experience
The design of the Movie Search App is clean and minimal, ensuring users can focus on finding the movie they want. Key aspects of the design include:

- **Clean Layout**: Simple, intuitive layout that presents movie data in a clear, organized way.
- **Accessibility**: The app adheres to basic accessibility guidelines, making it usable for a wider audience, including those relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: This app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides the building blocks for creating a responsive, dynamic app that reacts instantly to user input.
- **NPM**: Node Package Manager (NPM) is used to manage the app's dependencies and scripts. It makes it easy to install and manage third-party libraries and tools.
- **CSS**: The app uses basic CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and consistent design.

### API Integration

The Movie Search App fetches movie data using an external movie database API. The data is fetched via HTTP requests, and the responses are handled asynchronously using JavaScript's `fetch()` function. Some details about the API usage:

- **EndPoint**: The primary endpoint used is `/search/movie?query={movieTitle}`, where `{movieTitle}` is the movie name entered by the user.
- **Data Fetched**: The API returns movie data in JSON format, including the movie's title, poster image, and a brief description. This data is then rendered dynamically on the webpage.
